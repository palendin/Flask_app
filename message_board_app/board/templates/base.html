<!--Templates are HTML files with the capability of rendering dynamic content sent over from your Flask views. 
    For this, Flask uses the popular Jinja template engine, which you already installed as a dependency when you installed Flask.
    With a template engine like Jinja, you can embed Python-like expressions into your templates to create dynamic web content. 
    You can use loops, conditionals, and variables directly in your templates.
    Jinja also supports template inheritance, allowing the creation of a base template that you can extend in child templates, 
    promoting code reuse and a consistent layout across different pages of your project.-->

    
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Message Board - {% block title %}{% endblock title %}</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='styles.css') }}"> <!--this connects to styles.css, style should be at the <head> wrap-->
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to Message Board</h1>

{% include("_navigation.html") %} <!--this connects to _navigation.html, inserting the navigation menu into this position-->

<section>
  <header>
    {% block header %}{% endblock header %}
  </header>
  <main>
    {% block content %}<p>No messages.</p>{% endblock content %}
  </main>
</section>
</body>
</html> <!---->

<!--Since both home.html and about.html extend base.html, 
you didn’t need to make any changes in these templates to make the navigation menu appear. 
That’s template inheritance in action!-->
