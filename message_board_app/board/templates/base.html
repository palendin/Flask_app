<!--Templates are HTML files with the capability of rendering dynamic content sent over from your Flask views. 
    For this, Flask uses the popular Jinja template engine, which you already installed as a dependency when you installed Flask.
    With a template engine like Jinja, you can embed Python-like expressions into your templates to create dynamic web content. Y
    ou can use loops, conditionals, and variables directly in your templates.
    Jinja also supports template inheritance, allowing the creation of a base template that you can extend in child templates, 
    promoting code reuse and a consistent layout across different pages of your project.-->
